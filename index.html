          Hi,
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm Vicktoriia, I am a Russian born girl but I have been living in Germany since I was 19 and in Berlin the
          last 2 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work in the dentist industry. I am a working person, easygoing, quiet, clean and respectful. I am a
          professional dentist assistant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from that I'm a yoga lover, clown apprentice, enjoy dancing and joining friends outside when the weather
          allows it or spending time with my own at my cozy home with a warm tea.
        </p>

        <p>
          The apartment in Prenzlauerberg where I've been living for 2 wonderful years with my lovely flatmate has been
          requested by the owner and we have to leave :/. This is because I'm looking for a small solo
          apartment as soon as possible.
        <p>

        <p>
          I am looking for a solo flat, long term and with Anmeldung, 700e warm
          maximum. Moving date is flexible, though the earlier the better. I am
          a worker, professional in the dentist industry. I have all the papers,
          Schufa and the rest. I am super neat and take excellent care of my
          living space, no pet, quiet and non-smoker.
        </p>

        <p>
          The clinic where I work is located at Alexanderplatz and I would like to find a home place in a 5 ~ 7
          kilometres radius so I can go biking to work or with a nice public transport combination.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please give me a hint if you know about a place that could be a match with me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also don't hesitate asking me whatever you need to know and tell me about any condition you think is
          important.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many thanks for your help! :)
        </p>

        <p>
          Best Regards
